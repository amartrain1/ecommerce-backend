## Description
I made an application in which a user can navigate through an ecommerce database using GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes on products, categories, and tags.

## Installation
The user must install Node v18, inititialize it in their file, and run `npm i` to install Express.js, dotenv, mysql2, and sequelize.

## Usage
The user must first run `npm run seed` to seed their database. After that is complete, the user must run `npm start` to open the server. The user then navigates through a variety of links to work through the database. An example video is provided below.
